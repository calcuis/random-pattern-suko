## random-pattern-suku (modified sudoku game)

The provided Python code performs the following tasks:

The code begins by importing the `random` module, which provides functions to generate random numbers and perform random operations.

The code defines a function named `generate_random_pattern()`. This function generates a random pattern of digits from 1 to 9 by following these steps:

It creates a list named digits containing the numbers 1 through 9.

It shuffles the order of the digits within the digits list using the `random.shuffle()` function.

It converts the shuffled digits into a string named pattern by joining them together using the `join()` function and mapping each digit to a string using the `map()` function.

The generated pattern is returned by the function.

**Calculate Sums:** Another function named `calculate_sums(pattern)` is defined. This function calculates the sums of specific groups of digits within the pattern. It does so by:

Defining four sets of indices (i, j, k, l) that correspond to groups of digits within the pattern.

For each set of indices, it calculates the sum of the digits at those positions in the pattern string, converting each digit to an integer using `int(pattern[i])`.

The calculated sums are stored in a list named sums, and this list is returned by the function.

**Calculate Hints:** Similarly, a function named `calculate_hints(pattern)` is defined. This function calculates hints for specific groups of digits within the pattern. It operates similarly to the calculate_sums function, but instead of calculating sums, it calculates the sum of digits for each group of indices. The calculated hint sums are stored in a list named hints, which is returned by the function.

**Generate and Display Results:** The code generates a random pattern using the `generate_random_pattern()` function and stores it in the `random_pattern` variable. Then, it prints the generated random pattern.

It calls the `calculate_sums()` function with the random_pattern and prints the resulting sums.

It calls the `calculate_hints()` function with the random_pattern and prints the resulting hints.

### summary
This code generates a random pattern of digits, calculates sums and hints based on specific groups of digits within the pattern, and then prints the random pattern, sums, and hints. Each time the code is run, a new random pattern is generated, leading to different sums and hints.
